Spatial Remapping of snow models (SNODAS, NOAH-MP, SWANN, etc.) into the hydrofabric.
=======
This repository allows for the spatial remapping of snow models into the hydrofabric for intercomparison. 

This repository relies on the spatial remapping tool EASYMORE. https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE/blob/main/README.md

Snow models come in many different file formats and dimensions. The primary purpose of this repository is converting snow model data into a format that is usable by EASYMORE.
